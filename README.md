# Cluedo (Clue)

### What?
Mystery murder boardgame written in Unity.

### Why?
I wanted to get some experience with the Unity scripting API & (3D) modeling & texturing.
That's the reason that everything I use in this project (3D models, textures, ...) is my own creation (or at least with help from friends). I think creating a 'simple' board game can help me to learn these things.

### Contributions
It's a personal project and I find GitHub an easy way to use as a backup, but feel free to contribute or help me with this project ;)
